# WordFlow - A minimalistic typing game

## About The Project

I recently started getting into touch typing, and out of all the typing games I've tried, none of them really resonated with me. I'd enjoy a feature or two or a design choice in a website but dislike everything else, so I decided to make my own typing game with the exact design and features I liked.

## Features

* Infinite stream of words you probably haven't seen before
* Smooth caret cursor and blinking current letters
* Colored spell checking
* Light and dark modes

In the future, if this repo gets enough attention, I might connect it to a MongoDB for leaderboards, performance tracking, etc.

## Built With

![React](/src/assets/react.svg)

![Vite](/public/vite.svg)

![TypeScript](public/typescript.svg)

## Usage

Visit [WordFlow](seifhamdy.github.io/wordflow-typing-game/) and start typing. To restart, just refresh the page

## Roadmap

* [x] Add smooth caret
* [x] Add dark mode
* [ ] Add leaderboards and user profiles
* [ ] Multi-language Support
